# 👋 Hi, I'm Dylan Chai

I'm a Computer Science graduate from SETU (South East Technological University) with a strong focus on building clean, performant, and automated front-end solutions.

## 🚀 Featured Project

### [DylanChai.com](https://dylanchai.com)

> A zero-touch, fully automated developer portfolio site.

DylanChai.com is a **single-page, fully responsive portfolio** built with:

- ⚛️ **React** & **TypeScript** for modern component-based architecture
- ⚡ **Vite** for ultra-fast dev HMR and production builds
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** (customized via PostCSS) for sleek, utility-first styling
- 🖼️ **lucide-react** SVG icons for crisp visuals

### 🛠️ DevOps Highlights

A **CI/CD pipeline** powered by **GitHub Actions** handles every deploy:

1. Triggers on push to `main`
2. Runs `npm ci` and `npm run build`
3. Uses **SamKirkland's FTP-Deploy Action** to FTPS-deploy to a cPanel host

> ✅ The result? Every commit goes live automatically — no manual steps needed.
